- ensure enough effective durability before running pre-finisher vene
- spend good procs on intensive synth instead of precise touch during mid
- exploit good omen for vene->intensive during mid
- exploit good omen during finisher (gs if only inno is running, do not use observe->focused, use prep more?)
- use good prep under inno+gs+sturdy/good
- better use of pliant during finisher
- consider that baiting is very efficient due to tricks
- h&s+intensive is a decent progress finisher...
